<h1>An Overview of HRMS</h1>
<div class="b">
<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p><div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHuman Resource Management System (HRMS) refers to an array of software including Human Capital Management (HCM) and Human Resource Information System (HRIS)that help HR staff take care of an organization’s most valuable assets, people. HR tasks are too complex and time-consuming when performed manually. Leveraging the help of a technological solution like an HRMS can help you save time, cut costs, and manage your staff better.</div></p>
<p><div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDepending on your needs, you could opt for a simple HR Management Software with features that takes care of day-to-day administrative tasks like Employee Management, Leave Management, etc. Or you could choose a solution that addresses the strategic areas of human resource management like Training & Development, Performance Management, and Recruitment.</div><p>

<h2>Features you should look for in a Human Resource Management System (HRMS)</h2>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn addition to the comprehensive list of functionalities a robust HRMS tool should comprise of the following features:</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*Centralized admin system</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*Cloud-based documentation</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*Sophisticated mobile functionalities</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*Role-based access and collaboration</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*Agile integrations</p>

<h2>Components of HRMS</h2>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe major components of an HRMS are ATS, Employee Onboarding/Off-boarding, Time-off management, Payroll, and most importantly, Employee Information System.</p>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is a range of HRMS software available in the market depending on different shapes and sizes of businesses. For example, Freshteam is a comprehensive HRMS software that can help you automate a ton of workflows such as storing employee data, storing and parsing candidate resumes, saving potential candidates’ profiles in the talent pool, managing timeoff, onboarding and offboarding along with giving easy to use org charts and information system for employees.</div> 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo understand what exactly an HRMS does, let’s study the different components of HRMS in detail</p>
<div class="a">

<h3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1.ATS</h3>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn applicant tracking system(ATS) helps HR professionals to manage job postings, source candidates from different sources, screen resumes, engage with candidates, assess and make offers, and do more. Some of the major concerns of HR professionals these days are to do all of these from a central location and this is exactly what an HRMS serves for.</div>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLet’s try and understand some of the common HR challenges without an ATS:</p>
<h4>Customizing application forms and job descriptions.</h4>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn ideal ATS should allow you to customize your candidates’ application based on the role that they are applying for. Another herculean task is to write job descriptions each time you post a new job. With a comprehensive ATS, you can easily reuse the template that’s been readily provided with a few edits to bring in your org's brand.</div>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*Your company and job postings need to be omnipresent wherever your candidates are. Using an ATS, you can source candidates from multiple channels like -- LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook thus not restricting yourselves to just job sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*Screening resumes and storing them has always been hard. Ensure that your ATS helps you not just screen and store your resumes but also parse them for you so that you don’t have to shell out time doing manual data entry.</p>

<h3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2.Onboarding & Off-boarding</h3>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOnboarding involves tasks like monitoring onboarding tasks, sending out onboarding checklists to new hires and internal teams, sending welcome kits, getting candidates to e-sign are some of the onboarding tasks that your HRMS can help you automate and do in a breeze.</div>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChallenges in onboarding include sending out multiple documents, knowing how many have signed and how many have not and sending reminders to those, sending easy emails about day one, and more.</p>

<h3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3.Employee Information System</h3>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHuman errors are very common in Human Resource Management. Providing your employees the ability to self-service, lets them set up their profiles with the right information. It’s also important to understand who belongs to which team, who reports to whom to understand the organizational structure inside out. This is where org charts can be of great help. All your employees’ documents can also be recorded and maintained in one place using an Employee Information System . When you want to look up to someone, you can directly look into the employee directory for their email ID or phone number. You can also configure to restrict users from seeing specific information based on their roles.</div>

<h3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4.Time-off Management</h3>
<div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen you have multiple remote offices, it becomes tedious to communicate the time-offs/public holidays according to every region. An HRMS enables you to create custom time-off policies, define rules, and manage holidays. One of the main challenges with time-offs is keeping track of the carryovers and available ones. An HRMS should help your employees check their time off balances and book time-offs in just a few clicks. The manager receives an instant notification and can approve or decline it right away. It also helps managers keep track of unauthorized leaves thus reducing administrative time and costs.</div>
